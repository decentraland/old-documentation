Three dimensional scenes in Decentraland are based on the [Entity-Component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) model, where everything in a scene is an _entity_, and each entity can include _components_ that shape its characteristics and functionality.

Entities can be nested inside others to create a tree structure. In fact, all scenes must output a tree of nested entities. `.xml` scenes explicitly define this tree, `.xlt` scenes define typescript code that builds and updates this tree.

This document covers how to achieve common objectives by using different types of entities and components in a scene's tree.

## Create simple geometric shapes

Several basic shapes, often called _primitives_, can be added to a scene as predefined entity types. These already have certain components defined (like their shape) and let you set others (like their rotation and color).

The following types of entities are available:

- `<Box />`
- `<Sphere />`
- `<Plane />`
- `<Cylinder />`
- `<Cone />`

Any of these can be added to your scene, they can all include basic components like position, scale or color.

```tsx
<box position={vector} color="#ff00aa" scale={2} />
```

See [Entity interfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /sdk-reference/2018-06-21-entity-interfaces %}) for more details on these types of entities.

> Tip: When editing the code via a source code editor (like Visual Studio Code), you can see the list of components supported by a type of entity. Typically, this is done by placing the cursor in the entity and typing _Ctrl + Space bar_.

## Entity positioning

All entities can have a *position*, a *rotation* and a *scale*. These can be easily set as components, as shown below:

{% raw %}
```tsx
<box
    position={{ x: 5, y: 3, z: 5 }}
    rotation={{ x: 180, y: 90, z: 0 }}
    scale={0.5}
  />
```

{% endraw %}

- `position` is a _3D vector_, it sets the position on all three axes. These coordinates are measured in _meters_, unless you're positioning a child of a parent entity that has a scale that's different from 1, in which case the position is also scaled accordingly.
- `rotation` is a _3D vector_ too, but where each component represents the rotation in that axis.
- `scale` can either be a _number_ or a _3D vector_, in case you want to scale the axis in different proportions.

When an entity is nested inside another, the child entities inherit components from the parents. This means that if a parent entity is positioned, scaled or rotated, its children are also affected. The position, rotation and scale values of children entities don't override those of the parents, instead these are compounded.

You can include an invisible base entity to wrap a set of other entities and define their positioning as a group.

{% raw %}

```tsx
<entity position={{ x: 0, y: 0, z: 1 }} rotation={{ x: 45, y: 0, z: 0 }}>
  <box position={{ x: 10, y: 0, z: 0 }} scale={2} />
  <box position={{ x: 10, y: 10, z: 0 }} scale={1} />
  <box position={{ x: 0, y: 10, z: 0 }} scale={2} />
</entity>
```

{% endraw %}

You can also set a position, rotation and scale for the entire `<scene/>` entity and affect everything in the scene.

### Transitions

In dynamic scenes, you can configure an entity to affect the way in which it moves. By default, all changes to an entity are rendered as a sudden shift from one state to another. By adding a *transition*, you can make the change be gradual and more natural.

The example below shows a box entity that is configured to rotate smoothly.

{% raw %}
```tsx
 <box 
    rotation={currentRotation}
    transition={{ rorotation: { duration: 1000, timing: "ease-in" }}}
  />
```

{% endraw %}

> Note: The transition doesn't make the box rotate, it just sets the way it rotates whenever the value of the entity's rotation changes, usually as the result of an event.

The transition can be added to affect the following properties of an entity:

- position
- rotation
- scale
- color
- lookAt

Note that the transition for each of these properties is configured separately.

{% raw %}

```tsx
 <box
    rotation={currentRotation}
    color={currentColor}
    scale={currentScale}
    transition={
        { rotation: { duration: 1000, timing: "ease-in" }}
        { color: { duration: 3000, timing: "exponential-in" }}
        { scale: { duration: 300, timing: "bounce-in" }}
        }
  />
```

{% endraw %}

The transition allows you to set:

- A delay: milliseconds to wait before the change begins occuring.
- A duration: milliseconds from when the change begins to when it ends.
- Timing: select a function to shape the transition. For example, the transition could be `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `exponential-in` or `bounce-in`, among other options.

In the example below, a transition is applied to the rotation of an invisible entity that wraps a box. As the box is off-center from the parent entity, the box pivots like an opening door.

{% raw %}

```tsx
<entity rotation={currentRotation} transition={{ rotation: { duration: 1000, timing: "ease-in" } }}>
  <box id="door" scale={{ x: 1, y: 2, z: 0.05 }} position={{ x: 0.5, y: 1, z: 0 }} />
</entity>
```

{% endraw %}

### Turn to face the avatar

You can set an entity to act as a *billboard*, this means that it will always rotate to face the user. This was a common technique used in 3D games of the 90s, where most entities were planes that always faced the player, but the same can be used with and 3D model.

{% raw %}
```tsx
 <box 
    color={currentColor}
    billboard={7}
  />
```
{% endraw %}

You must provide this setting with a number that selects between the following modes:

*  0: No movement on any axis
*  1: Only move in the **X** axis, the rotation on other axis is fixed.
*  2: Only move in the **Y** axis, the rotation on other axis is fixed.
*  4: Only move in the **Z** axis, the rotation on other axis is fixed.
*  7: Rotate on all axis to follow the user.


If the entitiy is configured with both a specific rotation and a billboard setting, it uses the rotation set on by its billboard behavior.

### Turn to face a position

You can set an entity to face a specific position in the scene using *lookAt*. This is a way to set the rotation of an entity without having to deal with angles.

{% raw %}
```tsx
<box 
  color={currentColor}
  lookAt={{ x: 2, y: 1, z: 3 }}
  transition={{ lookAt: { duration: 500 } }}
/>
```
{% endraw %}

This setting needs a `Vector3Component` as a value, this vector indicates the coordinates of the point in the scene that it will look at. You can, for example, set this value to a variable in the scene state that is updated with another entity's position.

You can use a transition to make movements caused by lookAt smoother and more natural.

If the entitiy is configured with both a specific rotation and a lookAt setting, it uses the rotation set on by its lookAt behavior.

## Color

Color is set in hexadecimal values. To set an entity's color, simply set its `color` component to the corresponding hexadecimal value.

{% raw %}
```tsx
<sphere 
  position={{ x: 0.5, y: 1, z: 0 }}   
  color="#EF2D5E"
/>
```

{% endraw %}

> Tip: There are many online color-pickers you can use to find a specific color graphically. To name one, you can try the color picker on [W 3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp).

## Materials

Materials are defined as separate entities in a scene, this prevents material definitions from being duplicated, keeping the scene's code lighter.

Materials can be applied to primitive entities and to planes, simply by setting the `material` component.

{% raw %}

```tsx
<material 
  id="reusable_material" 
  albedoTexture="materials/wood.png" 
  roughness="0.5" 
/>
<sphere material="#reusable_material" />
```

{% endraw %}

Materials are also implicitly imported into a scene when you import a glTF model that includes embedded materials. When that's the case, the scene doesn't need a `<material />` entity declared.

### Texture mapping

An entity that uses a material can be configured to map specific regions of the texture to its faces. You do this by setting _u_ and _v_ coordinates on the 2D image of the texture to correspond to the vertices of the entity. The more vertices the entity has, the more _uv_ coordinates need to be defined on the texture, a plane for example needs to have 8 _uv_ points defined, 4 for each of its two faces.

{% raw %}

```tsx
async render() {
  return (
    <scene position={{ x: 5, y: 1.5, z: 5 }}>
      <basic-material
        id="sprite001"
        texture="atlas.png"
        samplingMode={DCL.TextureSamplingMode.NEAREST}
      />
      <plane
        material="#sprite001"
        uvs={[
          0,
          0.75,
          0.25,
          0.75,
          0.25,
          1,
          0,
          1,
          0,
          0.75,
          0.25,
          0.75,
          0.25,
          1,
          0,
          1
        ]}
      />
    </scene>
  );
}
```

{% endraw %}

To create an animated sprite, use texture mapping to change the selected regions of a same texture that holds all the frames.

### Transparent materials

To make a material transparent, you must add an alpha channel to the image you use for the texture. The `material` entity ignores the alpha channel of the texture image by default, so you must either:

- Set `hasAlpha` to true.
- Set an image in `alphaTexture`, which can be the same or a different image.

{% raw %}

```tsx
<material 
  albedoTexture="semiTransparentTexture.png" 
  hasAlpha 
/>
// or
<material 
  albedoTexture="semiTransparentTexture.png"
  alphaTexture="semiTransparentTexture.png" 
/>
```

{% endraw %}



### Basic materials

Instead of the `<material />` entity, you can define a material through the `<basic-material />` entity. This creates materials that are shadeless and are not affected by light. This is useful for creating user interfaces that should be consistenlty bright, it can also be used to give your scene a more minimalistic look.


{% raw %}
```tsx
<basic-material 
  id="basic_material" 
  texture="profile_avatar.png"
/>
<sphere
  material="#basic_material" 
/>
```
{% endraw %}

Materials are also implicitly imported into a scene when you import a glTF model that includes embedded materials. When that's the case, the scene doesn't need a `<material/>` entity declared.

## Import 3D models
 
For more complex shapes, you can build a 3D model in an external tool like Blender and then import them in *glTF* format.  [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf) (GL Transmission Format) is an open project by Khronos providing a common, extensible format for 3D assets that is both efficient and highly interoperable with modern web technologies.

> Note: When using Blender, you need an add-on to export glTF files. For models that don't include animations we recommend installing the add-on by [Kronos group](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter). To export glTFs that include animations, you should instead install the add-on by [Kupoman](https://github.com/Kupoman/blendergltf).

To add an external model into a scene, add a `<gltf-model>` element and set its `src` component to the path of the glTF file containing the model.

> Tip: We recommend keeping your models separate in a `/models` folder inside your scene.

{% raw %}
```tsx
<gltf-model
  position={{ x: 5, y: 3, z: 5 }}
  scale={0.5}
  src="models/myModel.gltf"
/>
```

{% endraw %}

glTF models can have either a `.gltf` or a `.glb` extension. glTF files are human-readable, you can open one in a text editor and read it like a JSON file. This is useful, for example, to verify that animations are properly attached and to check for their names. glb files are binary, so they're not readable but they are considerably smaller in size, which is good for the scene's performance. 

> Tip: We recommend using `.gltf` while you're working on a scene, but then switching to `.glb` when uploading it.

glTF models can also include their own textures and animations. Keep in mind that all models, their shaders and their textures must be within the parameters of the [scene limitations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /documentation/building-scenes/2018-01-06-scene-limitations %}).

> Note: Keep in mind that all models and their textures must be within the parameters of the [scene limitations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /sdk-reference/2018-01-06-scene-limitations %}).

> Note: obj models are also supported as a legacy feature, but will likely not be supported for much longer. To add one, use an `<obj-model>` entity. 

### Animations

Files with .gltf extensions can be opened with a text editor to view their contents. There you can find the list of animations included in the model and how they're named. Typically, an animation name is comprised of its armature name, an underscore and its animation name. For example `myArmature_animation1`. 


You activate an animation by adding *skeletalAnimation* settings to a gltf model and setting the `playing` property of one of its clips to `true`.

The example below imports a model that includes animations and configures them:

{% raw %}
```tsx
<gltf-model
  position={{ x: 5, y: 3, z: 5 }}
  scale={0.5}
  src="models/shark_anim.gltf"
  skeletalAnimation={[
    { clip: "shark_skeleton_bite", playing: false },
    { clip: "shark_skeleton_swim", weight: 0.2, playing: true }
  ]}
/>
```

{% endraw %}

In this example, the armature is named `shark_skeleton` and the two animations contained in it are named `bite` and `swim`.

An animation can be set to loop continuously by setting its `loop` property. If `loop:false` then the animation will be called only once when activated.

The `weight` property allows a single model to carry out multiple animations at once, calculating a weighted average of all the movements involved in the animation. The value of `weight` determines how much importance the given animation will be given.



### Free libraries for 3D models

Instead of building your own 3d models, you can also download them from several free or paid libraries.

To get you started, below is a list of libraries that have free or relatively inexpensive content:

- [Google Poly](https://poly.google.com)
- [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/)
- [Clara.io](https://clara.io/)
- [Archive3D](https://archive3d.net/)
- [SketchUp 3D Warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/)
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) (3D models made primarily for 3D printing, but adaptable to Virtual Worlds)
- [ShareCG](https://www.sharecg.com/)

> Note: Pay attention to the licence restrictions that the content you download has.

Note that most of the models that you can download from these sites won't be in glTF. If that's the case, you must convert them to glTF before you can use them in a scene. We recommend importing them into Blender and exporting them with one of the available glTF export add-ons.

### Why we use glTF?

Compared to the older _OBJ format_, which supports only vertices, normals, texture coordinates, and basic materials,
glTF provides a more powerful set of features. In addition to all of the features we just named, glTF also offers:

- Hierarchical objects
- Scene information (light sources, cameras)
- Skeletal structure and animation
- More robust materials and shaders

OBJ can currently be used for simple models that have no animations, but we will probably stop supporting it in the future.

Compared to _COLLADA_, the supported features are very similar. However, because glTF focuses on providing a
"transmission format" rather than an editor format, it is more interoperable with web technologies.

Consider this analogy: the .PSD (Adobe Photoshop) format is helpful for editing 2D images, but images must then be converted to .JPG for use
on the web. In the same way, COLLADA may be used to edit a 3D asset, but glTF is a simpler way of transmitting it while rendering the same result.

## Sound

You can add sound to your scene by including a sound component in any entity.

{% raw %}

```tsx
<sphere
  position={{ x: 5, y: 3, z: 5 }}
  sound={{
    src: "sounds/carnivalrides.ogg",
    loop: true,
    playing: true,
    volume: 0.5
  }}
/>
```

{% endraw %}

The `src` property points to the location of the sound file.

> Tip: We recommend keeping your sound files separate in a `/sounds` folder inside your scene.

Supported sound formats vary depending on the browser, but it's safe to use `.mp3`, `.accc` and `.ogg`. `.wav` files are also supported but not generally recommended as they are significantly larger.

Each entity can only play a single sound file. This limitation can easily be overcome by including multiple invisible entities, each with their own sound file.

The `distanceModel` property of the sound component conditions how the user's distance to the sound's source affects its volume. The model can be `linear`, `exponential` or `inverse`. When using the linear or exponential model, you can also set the `rolloffFactor` property to set the steepness of the curve.

<!---

Setting loop to false stops the audio, it doesn't pause it. So when setting loop to true the audio will start from the beginning.

Setting playing to false pauses??????


### How to use Blender with the SDK


how to add collider meshes into GLTF models

## Video

-->

## Entity collision

Entities that have collisions enabled occupy space and block a user's path, objects without collisions can be walked through by a user`s avatar.

{% raw %}
```tsx
<box 
  position={{ x: 10, y: 0, z: 0 }} 
  scale={2} 
  withCollisions={true}
/>

```

{% endraw %}

The example above defines a box entity that can't be walked through.

All entities have collisions disabled by default. Depending on the type of entity, collisions are enabled as follows:

- For most entities, including _primitives_ (boxes, spheres, etc), planes and base entities, you enable collisions by setting the `ignoreCollisions` component to `false`.
- To enable collisions in _glTF models_, you can either:

  - Overlay an invisible entity with the `ignoreCollisions` component set to `true`.
  - Edit the model in an external tool like Blender to include a _collider mesh_. The collider mesh must be named _x_collider_, where _x_ is the name of the model. So for a model named _house_, the collider mesh must be named _house_collider_.

A _collider mesh_ is a set of planes or geometric shapes that define which parts of the model are collided with. This allows for much greater control and is a lot less demanding on the system, as the collision mesh is usually a lot simpler (with less vertices) than the original model.

Collision settings currently don't affect how other entities interact with each other, entities can always overlap. Collision settings only affect how the entity interacts with the avatar.

Decentraland currently doesn't have a physics engine, so if you want entities to fall, crash or bounce, you must code this behavior into the scene.


> Tip: To view the limits of all collider meshes in the scene, launch your scene preview with `dcl preview` and click `c`. This draws blue lines that delimit collision areas.



## Migrating an XML scene to TypeScript

If you have a static XML scene and want to add dynamic capabilities to it, you must migrate it to TSX format. This implies making some minor changes to the entity syntax.

### Data types

> **TL;DR**  
> in XML: `position="10 10 10"`  
> in TSX: `position={ { x:10, y: 10, z: 10 } }`

There are subtle differences between the `text/xml` representation and the TSX representation of a scene. Our approach is TSX-first, and the XML representation of the scene is only a compatibility view. Because of this, attributes in TSX must be objects, not
plain text.

```xml
<scene>
  <box position="10 10 10" />
</scene>
```

The static scene above becomes the following dynamic schen when migrating it to TSX:

{% raw %}

```tsx
class Scene extends ScriptableScene {
  async render() {
    return (
      <scene>
        <box position={{ x: 10, y: 10, z: 10 }} />
      </scene>
    );
  }
}
```

{% endraw %}

#### Attribute naming

> **TL;DR**  
> in XML: `albedo-color="#ffeeaa"` (kebab-case)  
> in TSX: `albedoColor="#ffeeaa"` (camelCase)

HTML and XHTML are case insensitive for attributes, this generates conflicts with the implementation of certain attributes like `albedoColor`. Because reading `albedocolor` was confusing, and having hardcoded keys with hyphens in the code was so dirty, we decided to follow the React convention of having every property camel cased in code and hyphenated in the HTML/XML representation.

{% raw %}

```xml
<scene>
  <!-- XML -->
  <material id="test" albedo-color="#ffeeaa" />
</scene>
```

{% endraw %}

The static scene above becomes the following dynamic schen when migrating it to TSX:

{% raw %}

```tsx
// TSX
class Scene extends ScriptableScene {
  async render() {
    return (
      <scene>
        <material id="test" albedoColor="#ffeeaa" />
      </scene>
    );
  }
}
```

{% endraw %}
