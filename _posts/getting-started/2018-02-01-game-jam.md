## Install the CLI and get started

See the [Docs Home](docs.decentraland.org) for first steps to get started.

## Tutorials

Read our [tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /tutorials/2018-01-03-tutorials %}) for detailed instructions for building basic scenes.

## Engage with other Jammers

Visit [Discord](https://discord.gg/B2RcqE2), join a lively discussion about what’s possible and how!

You can also enrol in free courses at the [Decentraland University](https://discord.gg/UK6AZCd) channel.

## Team up

While you’re welcome to work on a project by yourself, the Game Jam experiences are often team efforts. Why not reach out to friends who might be a good match?

You can also check [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wCiDIkJwMVO9vUXU5oM4da14PASrwGHno1Ayrapsxa4/edit#gid=0) to post searches for team mates or find teams to join.


## Debug

To debug any issues, we encourage that you post issues to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask), using the tags `decentraland` or `decentraland-ecs`.

You can also ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/B2RcqE2). The `#developers` channel is for questions regarding code, the `#building` channel is for questions regarding 3D models and art.


## The Utils library

The Decentraland ESC Utils library includes a number of helper methods that make it easier to carry out a lot of common use cases.

To use any of the helpers provided by the Utils library:

1. Install it as an npm package. Run this command in your scene's project folder:

	```
	npm install decentraland-ecs-utils
	```
2. Import the library into the scene's script. Add this line at the start of your `game.ts` file, or any other TypeScript files that require it:

	```ts
	import utils from "../node_modules/decentraland-ecs-utils/index"
	```

3. In your TypeScript file, write `utils.` and let the suggestions of your IDE show the available helpers.

Read the full documentation of the Utils library [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/decentraland-ecs-utils)
