## Install the CLI and get started

See the [docs home](docs.decentraland.org) for first steps to get started.

## Tutoarials

Read our [tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /tutorials/2018-01-03-tutorials %}) for detailed instructions for building basic scenes.

## Engage with other participants

Visit [Discord](https://discord.gg/B2RcqE2), join a lively discussion about what’s possible and how!

While it’s possible to work on something by yourself, the best projects are often team efforts. We encourage you to reach out to any friends that might be a good match.

You can also check [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wCiDIkJwMVO9vUXU5oM4da14PASrwGHno1Ayrapsxa4/edit#gid=0) to post searches for team mates or find teams to join.


## Debug

To debug any issues, we encourage that you post issues to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask), using the tags `decentraland` or `decentraland-ecs`.

You can also ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/B2RcqE2). The `#developers` channel is for questions regarding code, the `#building` channel is for questions regarding 3D models and art.


## The Utils library

The Decentraland ESC Utils library includes a number of helper methods that make it easier to carry out a lot of common use cases.

To use any of the helpers provided by the utils library:

1. Install it as an npm package. Run this command in your scene's project folder:

	```
	npm install decentraland-ecs-utils
	```
2. Import the library into the scene's script. Add this line at the start of your `game.ts` file, or any other TypeScript files that require it:

	```ts
	import utils from "../node_modules/decentraland-ecs-utils/index"
	```

3. In your TypeScript file, write `utils.` and let the suggestions of your IDE show the available helpers.

Read the full documentation of the Utils library [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/decentraland-ecs-utils)
