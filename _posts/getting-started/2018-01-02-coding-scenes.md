## The development tools

At a very high level, the **Decentraland Software Development Kit** (SDK) allows you to do the following:

- Generate a default _project_ containing a Decentraland scene, including all the assets needed to render and run your content.
- Build, test, and preview the content of your scene locally in your web browser - completely offline, and without having to make any Ethereum transactions or own LAND.
- Write TypeScript code using the Decentraland API to add interactive and dynamic behavior to the scene.
- Upload the content of your scene to the content server.
- Link your LAND tokens to the URL of the content you have uploaded.

It includes the following components:

- **The Decentraland CLI** (Command Line Interface): Use it to generate new Decentraland scenes locally on your own machine, preview them and upload them to the content server.
- **The Decentraland API** (formerly known as _Metaverse API_ and still commonly referred to as _the API_): A TypeScript package containing the library of helper methods that allows you to create interactive experiences. Use it to create and manipulate objects in the scene and also to facilitate in-world transactions between users or other applications.

- **Scene exapmples**: Take inspiration and coding best practices from the [sample scenes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /examples/2018-01-08-sample-scenes %}).

## Requirements

To develop a scene locally, you don't need to own LAND tokens. Developing and testing a scene can be done completely offline, without the need to deploy a scene to the Ethereum network (the system Decentraland uses to establish ownership of LAND), or the content server.

This SDK is intended to be used by users that are comfortable working with code and a terminal. You must have the following:

- **npm** (Node package manager): Used in the terminal to handle scene dependencies. [Download link](https://www.npmjs.com/)

- **A source code editor**: Helps you create scenes a lot faster and with less errors, as it marks syntax errors, autocompletes while you write and even shows you smart suggestions that depend on the context that you're in. Click on an object in the code to see the full definition of its class and what attributes it supports. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

- **The Decentraland CLI**: Used to build, preview and upload scenes. See [Installation guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /getting-started/2018-01-01-installation-guide %})

## Supported languages and syntax

#### TypeScript (recommended)

We use [TypeScript (.tsx)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html)
to create our scenes.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so if you're familiar with JavaScript you'll find it's almost the same, but TypeScript allows you to employ object-oriented programming and type declarations. Features like autocomplete and type-checking speed up development times and allow for the creation of a solid codebase. These features are all key components to a positive developer experience.

In a Typescript scene, you handle the entities that are rendered in the scene as embedded XML assets. This works a lot like the [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) framework. This is why the scene's main file, _scene.tsx_ is a _.tsx_ rather than a _.ts_.

> **Note:** Even though scenes are written in a way that intentionally looks a lot like React, **our SDK does not use React**.

See [TypeScript tips]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /development-guide/2018-01-08-typescript-tips %}) for best practices and recommendations for writing Decentraland scenes using TypeScript.

#### XML

For scenes that only render montionless content and that won't be interactive, you can use [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).

When building your scene with the CLI, select the option _Static_.

We encourage developers to instead build their scenes using TypeScript. TypeScipt scenes include embedded XML tags to handle the rendered entities. If you ignore all of the Typescript code in a _Basic_ scene and only edit what's inside the `render()` function, you're dealing with what's essentially XML but with slightly different syntax.

#### Other languages

You can use another tool or language instead of TypeScript and compile it into JavaScript, as long as your compiled scripts are contained within a single JavaScript file named _scene.js_. All provided type declarations are made in TypeScript, and other languages and transpilers are not officially supported.

## Scenes

The content you deploy to your LAND is called a **scene**. A scene is an interactive program that renders content, this could be a game, an interactive experience, an art gallery, whatever you want!

Scenes are deployed to **parcels**, the 10 meter by 10 meter pieces of virtual LAND, the scarce and non-fungible asset maintained in an Ethereum smart contract. These parcels of virtual space are where you will upload and interact with the content you create using the SDK.

We are developing the web client that will allow users to explore Decentraland. All of the content you upload to your LAND will be rendered and viewable through this client. We have included a preview tool in the SDK so that you can preview, test, and interact with your content in the meantime.

## Entities and Components

Entities are the basic unit for building everything in Decentraland scenes, think of them as the equivalent of Elements in a DOM tree in web development.

Three dimensional scenes in Decentraland are based on the [Entity-Component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) model, where everything in a scene is an _entity_, and each entity can include _components_ that shape its characteristics and functionality.

Entities are all of the assets that you include in your scenes that users will be able to render, view, and interact with from their web browser. These include 3D objects and audio files.

Components define the traits of an entity. For example, you can include the `color` component on an entity to set its color, or include the `lookAt` component to rotate it to face a certain point in space.

> Note: The term _component_ as used in reference to this model differs greatly from how it's used in the _React_ ecosystem, where everything is considered a _component_. Throughout our documentation, we will use the term _component_ as used by the Entity-Component model.

An entity can have other entities as children, these inherit the components from the parent. If a parent entity is positioned, scaled or rotated, its children are also affected. Invisible entities can also be used as wrappers that only exist to handle multiple entities as a group. Thanks to this, we can arrange entities into trees.

For additional terms, definitions, and explanations, please refer to our [complete Glossary]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /general/2018-01-03-glossary %}).

See [Entity interfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /development-guide/2018-06-21-entity-interfaces %}) for a reference of all the available constructors for predefined entities and all of the supported components of each.

## The Render function

All [scene objects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /development-guide/2018-01-05-scriptable-scene %}) have a 'render()` method that outputs what users of your scene will see on their browser. This function must always output a hierarchical tree of entities that starts at the root level with a _scene_ entity.

{% raw %}

```tsx
 async render() {
    return (
      <scene position={{ x: 5, y: 0, z: 5 }}>
        <box
          position={{ x: 2, y: 1, z: 0 }}
          scale={{ x: 2, y: 2, z: 0.05 }}
          color="#0000FF"
        />
        <entity
          rotation={this.state.doorRotation}
          transition={{ rotation: { duration: 1000, timing: 'ease-in' } }}
        >
          <box
            id="door"
            scale={{ x: 1, y: 2, z: 0.05 }}
            position={{ x: 0.5, y: 1, z: 0 }}
            color="#00FF00"
          />
        </entity>
      </scene>
    )
  }
```

{% endraw %}

If you have game development experience with other tools, you might expect scenes to have some kind of render loop that periodically renders elements in the screen. Decentraland doesn't work like that. We built the API based on _events_, so the `render()` function is designed to update the scene in reaction to events rather than by querying the world repeatedly.

Scenes have a [state]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /development-guide/2018-01-04-scene-state %}), which is a collection of variables that change over time and represent the current disposition of the scene. The state changes by the occurrence of [events]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /development-guide/2018-01-03-event-handling %}) in the scene. When the state changes, this retriggers the rendering of the scene, using the new values of the state.

This is inspired by the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework, most of what you can read about React applies to decentraland scenes as well.

## Scene Decoupling

Your scenes don't run in the same context as the engine
(a.k.a. the main thread), they might even not run in the same computer as the engine. We created the SDK in a way that is
entirely decoupled from the rendering engine. We designed it to be like this for both safety and performance reasons.

The decoupling works by using RPC protocol, this protocol assigns a small part of the client to only render the scene and control events.

We have also abstracted the communication protocol. This allows us to run the scenes locally in a WebWorker.

We don't want developers to intervene with the internals of the engine or even need to know what lies inside the engine. We need to ensure a consistent experience for users throughout the Decentraland map, and mistakes are more likely to happen at that "low" level.

Because of this decoupling, your scene's code doesn't have access to the DOM or the `window` object, so you can't access data like the user's browser or geographical location.

#### Decoupling a scene from the engine

Let's take a look at an example. Suppose you want to render a scene with the following content:

{% raw %}

```tsx
<scene>
  <gltf-model src="models/a.gltf" />
  <sphere position={{ x: 10, y: 10, z: 10 }} />
</scene>
```

{% endraw %}

While writing your scene's code, you have no need to actually load the `a.gltf` model, and you don't need to know the geometry indexes used by the sphere entity. All you need to do is describe the scene at a higher level, like you do in XML.

Once the `render()` function sends this scene to the engine, the engine takes care of the positions, assets and geometries.

To optimize performance, we only send the changes in the scene to the actual client, not the entire contents of it. So if the scene has a shoal of
fish and only one of them moves, the API will send only that delta to the client, the one fish that moved. This makes things faster for the client and is completely transparent to the developer of the scene.

## Taking Inspiration from React

One of the goals we had when designing our SDK was to reduce the learning curve as much as possible. We also wanted to incentive good practices and the writing of maintainable code, respecting the remote async-rpc constraints in every case.

To make a long story short, we were considering two approaches for doing this:

- **the jQuery way**: tell the system how to handle entities, create, mutate and try to reach a desired state.
- **the React way**: tell the system the desired state and let it figure out how to get there.

#### The _jQuery_ way

If we had chosen the jQuery way (which we didn't), the code needed to create our example scene would look like this:

{% raw %}

```ts
// WARNING: This code sample is only hypothetical,
// This is not valid syntax
// and is not supported by our tools

let scene = metaverse.createScene()
let objModel = metaverse.createObjModel()
let sphere = metaverse.createSphere()

objModel.setAttribute("src", "models/a.gltf")
objModel.appendTo(scene)

sphere.setAttribute("position", { x: 10, y: 10, z: 10 })
sphere.appendTo(scene)

EntityController.render(scene)
```

{% endraw %}

In this example, we're telling the system how to reach a desired state, the example (ab)uses mutations and
side effects of how the code works to reach the desired state.

#### The _React_ way

We chose to do things the [React](https://reactjs.org/) way, so our code for creating the same scene as above looks like this:

{% raw %}

```tsx
// IMPORTANT: This code is only an example, it does not exist nor work
 async render() {
   return (
    <scene>
      <obj-model src="models/a.gltf" />
      <sphere position={{ x: 10, y: 10, z: 10 }} />
    </scene>
  )
}
```

{% endraw %}

In this example, we're just telling the system the desired state, instead of describing all of the logic to get to that state.

We made our SDK following the React approach, for several reasons:

- It takes advantage of the evolution of web technologies that occurred in the past 10 years.
- It's simpler to understand, it removes tons of boilerplate code that's not related to the business logic of the scene.
- It's declarative. You describe **what** you want, not **how** you want that to happen.
- It helps onboard developers that are already familiar with React.
- The pattern is well known and well documented, getting help should be easy.
- It has a low memory footprint and it makes it easy to do garbage collection.
