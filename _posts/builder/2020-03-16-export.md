You can start a scene with the Builder, and then make it more interactive by writing code with the SDK (Software Development Kit).

The Builder uses the Decentraland SDK under the hood, generating the required code without you ever needing to look at it. If you export the scene, then you can alter its code directly.

To export a scene, open the scene and click the export icon.

This will export the scene as a .zip file. This zip file will contain all of the required code and supporting files to run the scene, including 3D models, sound files, etc.

See [SDK 101]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /development-guide/2020-03-16-SDK-101 %}) if you're not yet familiar with coding with the Decentraland SDK.

## Workflow

Start your scene in the Builder, and only export it when you're sure you won't be making any more changes to it from the Builder.

Once you modify your scene with the SDK, you canâ€™t import those changes back into the Builder. You can only go from the Builder to the SDK, not in the other direction.

> Note: If you attempt to reimport the scene into the Builder, the only file in the project folder that is considered is the `builder.json` file, that was generated when exporting from the Builder. Any changes you did to other files, like `game.ts`, are ignored when importing.

Alternatively, you can keep all SDK changes in a neat section of your code, and manually paste these into newly exported versions of the Builder scene as you iterate it.

## Smart items

If the scene contains smart items, each smart item is exported as a separate folder that contains all the supporting code, 3D models, sound files, etc. These smart item folders are named using the smart item's hash, for example _1fc96600-3d45-45f6-b364-86aa8cd15587_.

You can modify the code for a smart item by changing the item's `item.ts` file. Keep in mind that this will change all of the instances of that smart item in the scene.
