# 4.1.0

- A few packages have been rebranded:

  - metaverse-api is now decentraland-api
  - metaverse-rpc is now decentraland-rpc
  - metaverse-compiler is now decentraland-compiler

When migrating a scene to 4.1.0, keep in mind that the first lines of the file that import from `metaverse-api` must be changed to import from `decentraland-api`.

{% raw %}

```tsx
import * as DCL from "decentraland-api"
import { Vector3Component } from "decentraland-api"
```

{% endraw %}

- The new `onClick` handler can be added to any entity to handle click events in the same way that React handles clicks. This can greatly simplify scene code, for example:

**Old way**

{% raw %}

```tsx
import * as DCL from "decentraland-api"

export default class InteractiveCubeScene extends DCL.ScriptableScene {
  state = {
    size: 1
  }

  sceneDidMount() {
    this.eventSubscriber.on("interactiveBox_click", async () => {
      this.resizeBox()
    })
  }

  resizeBox = () => {
    this.setState({ size: Math.random() * 3 })
  }

  async render() {
    return (
      <scene>
        <box
          id="interactiveBox"
          withCollisions
          scale={this.state.size}
          position={{ x: 5, y: 1, z: 5 }}
        />
      </scene>
    )
  }
}
```

{% endraw %}

**New way**

{% raw %}

```tsx
import * as DCL from "decentraland-api"

export default class InteractiveCubeScene extends DCL.ScriptableScene {
  state = {
    size: 1
  }

  resizeBox = () => {
    this.setState({ size: Math.random() * 3 })
  }

  async render() {
    return (
      <scene>
        <box
          onClick={this.resizeBox}
          withCollisions
          scale={this.state.size}
          position={{ x: 5, y: 1, z: 5 }}
        />
      </scene>
    )
  }
}
```

{% endraw %}

Note that the new way saves you from having to create and subscribe to a click event, and attaching and ID to every element that needs to handle a click. Using this handler, the entity doesn't require an ID to be clicked. All you need to do is pass a function through an `onClick` JSX attribute and enjoy!

- The parcel limits are now inclusive.

Before, entities couldn't reach the border of the scene's parcels, you needed to limit positions to something like `{ x: 9.9, y:1, z: 9.9}` in a 1 parcel scene. Now you can position things up to the very limit of the parcels, so on a 1 parcel scene entities can reach `{ x: 10, y:1, z: 10}`

- Static scenes have better performance

- A bug was fixed where an entitie's `lookAt` value couldn't be the same as the value for `position`. This was problematic in scenarios where you need a character to move slowloy towards a position (with a transition) and look in that direction as it does. Now this scenario is fully supported.

- Preview scenes have a new lighting configuration. Previous lighting conditions were too bright and didn't allow the geometry of certain shapes to be seen clearly.
