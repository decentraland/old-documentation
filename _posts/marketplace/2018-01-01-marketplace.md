## What is it?

The Marketplace is the go-to place to trade and manage all your Decentraland's assets.

Specifically, the Marketplace allows you to:

- **Publish** a parcel of LAND for sale, setting your own price in MANA and an expiration date for the offer.
- **Buy** a parcel that is for sale.
- **Name** your parcel and give it a description.
- **Transfer** your LAND to a different user.
- **Control** the parcels you own and visualize the contributions you’ve made to districts.
- **Explore** the world through a map to see who owns what.

> Please remember that this is a beta release, and the Marketplace might contain a few bugs. We kindly ask that you protect your personal information, property, and content. If you run into any issues or would like to provide feedback, click on the Intercom Widget right in the Marketplace.

## Where can I find it?

You can access the Marketplace at [market.decentraland.org](https://market.decentraland.org/)

# How do I use it?

## Your Wallet

Before using [market.decentraland.org](https://market.decentraland.org), connect and unlock your [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) account or [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist) account. We also support the use of a [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) hardware wallet.

If you would like to use your Ledger hardware wallet in the Marketplace, first enable browser support on your device. Next, plug your device into your computer, and select the address you used during the auction. Finally, unlock your wallet and load up the Marketplace.

> If you purchased LAND during the Land Auction, make sure that you log in to the wallet that you used during the auction.

## The Atlas View

The Atlas view gives you a bird’s-eye perspective of every color coded parcel, road, district, and plaza in Decentraland.

You can click and drag the map to move around, zoom in and out, or hover your cursor over a parcel to see its x,y location and owner.

Any parcel that is currently for sale in the Marketplace will be highlighted.

Click Color Key in the footer to see a list of what each status the different colored tiles represent in the Atlas. You can always hover your cursor over a parcel to view it’s status, its coordinates, and its owner’s public address (if it’s already taken).

## The Marketplace View

If you’d rather see a list of every parcel currently offered on the market, you can use the Marketplace View. You can sort offers by “Newest”, “Cheapest”, “Most expensive”, and “Closest to expire”. To learn more about a particular parcel that’s for sale, simply click the tile in the Marketplace.

## Managing Your LAND

To view your LAND, click My Land. Here you’ll find a list of all of your parcels, including any that you’ve contributed to community districts and any parcels that you have listed for sale.

By clicking on one of the parcels listed under My Land, you can edit its name, description, put it up for sale, or transfer it directly to another wallet address.

## Conducting Transactions

> Before buying or selling LAND you first have to authorize the Marketplace to perform secure exchanges for your account from the settings page. Once you have authorized the Marketplace to operate MANA and LAND on your behalf, you’re ready to start trading!

Aside from the small gas fee required by the miners for every transaction conducted on the Ethereum network, Decentraland does not collect any surplus trading fees.

If you have another account that you want to move your LAND to, or if you want to send LAND to a friend without charging them any MANA, you can make a direct transfer to any other wallet address simply by clicking Transfer from that parcel’s page.
