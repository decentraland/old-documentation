By interacting with the Ethereum blockchain you can, for example, require that a user pays a fee before activating something in your scene. The SDK is currently experimenting with different ways to interface with the Ethereum blockchain. Currently there are three ways you can achieve this:

- Using the Web3 API
- Using the `ethjs` library
- Using the `eth-connect` library

> IMPORTANT: At the present time, none of these solutions are fully supported by the SDK, and the way in which they are implemented is very likely to change. For this reason, we advise that you only try these out for proofs of concept, but not to develop final experiences.

## Obtain a user's public key

You can obtain a user's public Ethereum key by using `getUserPublicKey()`. You can then use this information to send payments to the user, or as a way to recognize users.

The example below imports the `UserIdentity` library and runs `getUserPublicKey()` to get the public key of the user's Metamask account and log it to console. The user must be logged into their Metamask account on their browser for this to work.

{% raw %}

```tsx
import { createElement, inject, UserIdentity } from "decentraland-api/src"

export default class Scene extends ScriptableScene<any, any> {
  @inject("Identity")
  userIdentity: UserIdentity

  state = {
    publicKey: ""
  }

  async sceneDidMount() {
    const publicKey = await this.userIdentity!.getUserPublicKey()
    this.setState({ publicKey })
    console.log(this.state.publicKey)
  }

  render() {
    return <scene />
  }
}
```

{% endraw %}

## Web3 API

The SDK includes an interface for the Web3 API. You can use it to call methods of this API from your scene's code. The interface includes two methods: `send` and `sendAsync`, which can be used to call the methods from the API. We have only whitelisted the following methods from the API, all others are currently not supported:

- eth_sendTransaction
- eth_getTransactionReceipt
- eth_estimateGas
- eth_call
- eth_getBalance
- eth_getStorageAt
- eth_blockNumber
- eth_gasPrice
- eth_protocolVersion
- net_version
- eth_getTransactionCount
- eth_getBlockByNumber

To use it, you must first install web3 in your local machine. To do so, run the following:

```bash
npm i web3
```

> IMPORTANT: The SDK works with version _0.20.6_ of the Web3 library. It doesn't currently support newer versions.

Below is a sample that uses this API to get the contents of a block in the blockchain.

{% raw %}

```tsx
import { createElement, ScriptableScene } from "decentraland-api"
import Web3 = require("web3")

export default class EthereumProvider extends ScriptableScene {
  async sceneDidMount() {
    const provider = await this.getEthereumProvider()
    const web3 = new Web3(provider)

    web3.eth.getBlock(48, function(error: Error, result: any) {
      console.log("Eth block 48 (from scene)", result)
    })
  }

  async render() {
    return <scene />
  }
}
```

{% endraw %}

For more details and a full reference of what's possible with this API, see [Web3's documentation](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/)

## ethjs library

To use it, you must first install ethjs in your local machine. To do so, run the following:

```bash
npm install --save ethjs
```

For more details and a full reference of what's possible with this library, see [ethjs's documentation](https://github.com/ethjs/ethjs)

<!--
## The Ethereum Controller

Another way to perform operations on the Ethereum blockchain is through the ethereum controller. This controller is packaged with the SDK, so you don't need to run any manual installations. You must first import it into your scene:

1.  Import the `EthereumController` to the .tsx file:

{% raw %}

```tsx
import {
  createElement,
  ScriptableScene,
  EthereumController,
  inject
} from "decentraland-api"
```

{% endraw %}

2.  Then inject the ethereum controller as a decorator into your custom scene class:

{% raw %}

```tsx
export default class myScene extends ScriptableScene {
  @inject("experimentalEthereumController")
  eth: EthereumController
  // (...)
}
```

{% endraw %}

The examples below show some of the things you can do with this controller.

#### Require a payment

Once the `EthereumController` has been imported, you can run the `requirePayment` function. This function prompts the user to accept a paying a sum to an Ethereum wallet of your choice. Users must always accept payments manually, a payment can never be implied directly from the user's actions in the scene.

{% raw %}

```tsx
this.eth.requirePayment(receivingAddress, amount, currency)
```

{% endraw %}

The function requires that you specify an Ethereum wallet address to receive the payment, an amount for the transaction and a specific currency to use (for example, MANA or ETH).

If accepted by the user, the function returns the hash number of the transaction that has been started.

{% raw %}

```tsx
const myWallet = ‘0x0123456789...’
const enterPrice = 10

// (...)

async sceneDidMount() {
  this.eventSubscriber.on(‘door_click’, async () => {
    await this.eth!.requirePayment(myWallet, entrancePrice, ‘MANA’)

    this.setState(isDoorClosed: !this.state.isDoorClosed)
  }
}
```

{% endraw %}

The example above listens for clicks on a `door` entity. When clicked, the user is prompted to make a payment in MANA to a specific wallet for a given ammount. Once the user accepts this payment, the rest of the function can be executed, in this case the `isDoorClosed` variable in the scene's state is changed. If the user doesn't accept the payment, the rest of the function won't be executed and the variable's state won't change.

![](/images/media/metamask_confirm.png)

> Tip: We recommend defining the wallet address and the ammount to pay as global constants at the start of the _.tsx_ file. These are values you might need to change in the future, setting them as constants makes it easier to update the code.

#### Using the Ethereum test network

While testing your scene, to avoid transferring real MANA currency, you can use the _Ethereum Ropsten test network_ and transfer fake MANA instead.

To use the test network you must set your Metamask Chrome extension to use the _Ropsten test network_ instead of _Main network_.

You must also own MANA in the Ropsten blockchain. To obtain free Ropsten mana in the test network, go to our [MANA faucet](https://faucet.decentraland.today/).

> Tip: To run the transaction of transferring Ropsten MANA to your wallet, you will need to pay a gas fee in Ropsten Ether. If you don't have Ropsten Ether, you can obtain it for free from various external faucets like [this one](https://faucet.ropsten.be/).

To preview your scene using the test network, add the `DEBUG` property to the URL you're using to access the scene preview on your browser. For example, if you're accessing the scene via `http://127.0.0.1:8000/?position=0%2C-1`, you should set the URL to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/?DEBUG&position=0%2C-1`.

Any transactions that you accept while viewing the scene in this mode will only occur in the test network and not affect the MANA balance in your real wallet.

## Wait for a transaction

Another thing that the ethereum controller allows you to do is check if a specific transaction has been already mined. This looks for a specific transaction's hash number and verifies that it has been validated by a miner and added to the blockchain.

{% raw %}

```tsx
await this.eth.waitForMinedTx(currency, tx, receivingAddress)
```

{% endraw %}

The function requires that you specify a currency to use (for example, MANA or ETH), a transaction hash number and the Ethereum wallet address that received the payment.

{% raw %}

```tsx
const myWallet = ‘0x0123456789...’

// (...)

async sceneDidMount() {
  this.eventSubscriber.on(‘door_click’, async () => {
    const tx = await this.eth!.requirePayment(myWallet, entrancePrice, ‘MANA’)
    const userPaid = await this.eth!.waitForMinedTx(currency,tx, receivingAddress)
    this.setState(isDoorClosed: !this.state.isDoorClosed)
  }
}
```

{% endraw %}

The example above first requires the user to accept a transaction, if the user accepts it, then `requirePayment` returns a hash that can be used to track the transaction and see if it's been mined. Once the transaction is mined and accepted as part of the blockchain, the `isDoorClosed` variable in the scene state is changed.

<!--

#### Signing messages

A user can sign a message using their Ethereum public key. This signature is a secure way to give consent or to register an accomplishment or action that is registered with the block chain. The signing of a message doesn't imply paying any gas fees on the Ethereum network.

Messages that can be signed need to be follow a specific format to match safety requirements. They must include the “Decentraland signed header” at the top, this prevents the possibility of any mismanagement of the user’s wallet.

Signable messages should follow this format:

```
# DCL Signed message
<key 1>: <value 1>
<key 2>: <value 2>
<key n>: <value n>
Timestamp: <time stamp>
```

For example, a signable message might look like this:

```tsx
# DCL Signed message
Attacker: 10
Defender: 123
Timestamp: 1512345678
```

Before a user can sign a message, you must first convert it into an object using the `convertMessageToObject()` function, then it can be signed with the `signMessage()` function.

{% raw %}

```tsx
const messageToSign = `# DCL Signed message
Attacker: 10
Defender: 123
Timestamp: 1512345678`

const convertedMessage = await this.eth!.convertMessageToObject(messageToSign)
const { message, signature } = await this.eth!.signMessage(convertedMessage)
```

{% endraw %}

#### Checking if a message is correct

To verify that the message that the user signed is in fact the one that you want to send, you can use the `utils.toHex` function, from the `decentraland-eth` package, to convert it and easily compare it.

To use this, you must first install some dependencies manually in your scene's directory. Navigate to your scene's folder and run the following:

```bash
npm install --save decentraland-eth
```

You must then import these dependencies on the _.tsx_ file

{% raw %}

```tsx
import { eth } from "decentraland-eth"
```

{% endraw %}

{% raw %}

```tsx
const { message, signature } = await this.eth!.signMessage(convertedMessage);

const messageHex = await eth.utils.toHex(messageToSign)
const isEqual = message === messageHex
console.log(‘Is the message correct?’, isEqual)
```

{% endraw %}

#### Example:

{% raw %}

```tsx
import { inject, EthereumController, createElement, ScriptableScene } from 'decentraland-api'
import { eth } from 'decentraland-eth'

const messageToSign = `# DCL Signed message
Attacker: 10
Defender: 123
Timestamp: 1512345678`

export default class SignMessage extends ScriptableScene {
 @inject('experimentalEthereumController')
 eth: EthereumController | null = null

 async sceneDidMount() {
   this.subscribeTo('click', async e => {
     if (e.elementId === 'button-sign') {
       await this.signMessage()
     }
   })
 }

 async signMessage() {
   const convertedMessage = await this.eth!.convertMessageToObject(messageToSign)
   const { message, signature } = await this.eth!.signMessage(convertedMessage)

   console.log({ message, signature })

   const messageHex = await eth.utils.toHex(messageToSign)

   const isEqual = message === messageHex
   console.log("Is the message correct?", isEqual)
 }

 async render() {
   return (
     <scene position={{ x: 5, y: 0, z: 5 }}>
       <entity position={{ x: -3, y: 1.4, z: -3 }}>
         <plane id="button-sign" scale={{ x: 0.8, y: 0.2, z: 1 }} color="#bada55" />
         <text value="Sign message" fontSize={60} color="black" />
       </entity>
     </scene>
   )
 }
```

{% endraw %}
