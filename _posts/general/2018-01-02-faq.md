## How can I visit Decentraland?

Decentraland is still under active development by the community. Three experiences will be available across several devices: you’ll be able to visit Decentraland from a mobile device, your desktop browser, and through a VR headset. For progress updates and news [please visit our blog](https://blog.decentraland.org/).

## What is MANA?

[MANA](https://etherscan.io/token/decentraland) is Decentraland’s fungible, ERC20 cryptocurrency token. MANA is burned, or spent, in exchange for LAND parcels. For a current summary of critical stats like total and circulating supply, please visit our [MANA Token Information](https://transparency.decentraland.org/) transparency dashboard. See the [Glossary](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/glossary/) for more information.

## Will I be able to buy things other than LAND with MANA?

Yes! In addition to burning MANA in exchange for LAND, users will be able to trade MANA with other users in exchange for goods and services hosted within Decentraland.

## What is LAND?

LAND is a non-fungible digital asset maintained in an Ethereum smart contract. LAND is divided into parcels that are referenced using unique x,y cartesian coordinates. Each LAND token includes a record of its coordinates, its owner, and a reference to a content description file or [parcel manifest](https://github.com/decentraland/proposals/blob/master/dsp/0020.mediawiki) that describes and encodes the content the owner wishes to serve on his or her land.

## How large is a tile of LAND?

Land parcels are 16m x 16m, or 52ft x 52ft. Height is restricted based on [these limitations]{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /development-guide/2018-01-06-scene-limitations %}).

## What is an Estate?

Like LAND, an estate is a non-fungible digital asset. An estate is an association of two or more directly adjacent parcels of LAND. These parcels must be directly adjacent, and cannot be separated by a road, plaza, or any other parcel. By connecting parcels to form Estates, you can more easily manage your larger LAND holdings. Estates are especially useful when building larger scenes that span more than one parcel.

## How can I buy LAND or Estates in Decentraland?

You can visit the **[Decentraland Marketplace](https://market.decentraland.org)** to browse through all of the available LANDs or Estates of LAND that are currently for sale.

On December 15th, 2017, we held our first LAND auction, called the Terraform Event, to distribute the first parcels of LAND to the community. The auction concluded in January 2018 and LAND tokens have been distributed to participants.

## What does “owning” virtual land mean, and how does it work?

Land within Decentraland is represented by non-fungible LAND tokens (meaning that each is unique and cannot be replicated) that track ownership on the Ethereum blockchain. Owning LAND within Decentraland is akin to owning any other unique, crypto asset like [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) or [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), however you will be able to use your LAND within Decentraland to build three dimensional spaces and applications. LAND is
built on our [ERC721](https://github.com/decentraland/erc721) standard, making it a digital asset that can be traded with other users, like other digital assets.

## Why is land scarce?

Like CryptoKitties and CryptoPunks, LAND is a non-fungible digital asset. To ensure that the value of land parcels remains stable, the amount of land in Decentraland corresponds to the fixed, total amount of MANA.

Without LAND scarcity, many parcels would likely be left abandoned, negatively impacting the quality of content in Decentraland and the user experience.

## Does Decentraland run on top of its own blockchain?

Decentraland uses the Ethereum blockchain to store and verify information about LAND ownership and LAND content. It does not run on its own independent blockchain. Content within Decentraland is hosted and served to users via our own content server.

## Who validates transactions?

The Ethereum LAND smart contract registers any changes to the state of a parcel of LAND, such as a change in the contents of the LAND or a transfer of ownership. These changes are recorded and verified by the Ethereum blockchain.

## How is content distributed?

The visual, audio, and three dimensional content of Decentraland will be stored in our content server. When you visit Decentraland, the content needed to render your location will be pulled from the content server. Each LAND token, stored on the Ethereum blockchain, is associated with an x,y location within the world and links to the content for that location.

## What tools should I use to start building in Decentraland?

The Decentraland WebVR platform is being built on [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) and the Decentraland editor will be based on the [A-Frame inspector](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-inspector) and our [Command Line Interface](doc:command-line-interface). You will be able to use tools like SketchUp, Blender, and Maya to create 3D models that you can then import into Decentraland. The exact details describing Decentraland’s content creation and publication workflow are still under
development. Please stay tuned for future updates!

## How do I avoid being “boxed-in” by surrounding parcels?

Decentraland’s client design has a number of solutions to this problem, although not all will necessarily be implemented. These solutions may include a ghost mode allowing players to clip through unrestricted parcels, unrestricted teleportation, functionality in plazas that exposes quality content, and design incentives that enable users to create content that doesn’t visually box-in adjacent parcels.

## Will I be able to control who can see content on my parcels?

Yes. You will be able to control how certain content on your parcel is served to other users within the Decentraland platform. For example, you could make 3D models, images, video, or sound content only visible to a user in Decentraland after they have submitted a payment or fulfilled some other requirement.

However, remember that by uploading content to the content server you are essentially making it publicly available since the content server is a distributed file system. While we intend to make it possible to limit how that content is served to users through a Decentraland client, the content itself will always remain discoverable on the content server.

**You will be able to control who you can see and interact with (and who can see and interact with you) within Decentraland.** For example, imagine that you have a house on your parcel and you only want to invite certain friends into your house. You will be able to specify which users you can see (and which users can see you) within your house, but you won’t necessarily be able to prevent anyone from seeing your house or its contents since the assets required to render your house reside on the content server.

**Can I monetize my content?**
Yes. You are free to decide whether you will charge other users to access your content and how you will implement said charge. Decentraland is in no way involved in the monetization of your content and does not guarantee any return, profit or income. The success of the platform depends entirely on the efforts of the users. Your fate, your success, and eventually your journey, depends on you, your efforts, your imagination.
