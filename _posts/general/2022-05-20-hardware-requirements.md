These are the minimum hardware specs required to successfully run the Decentraland explorer.

The minimum requirements differ depending on if you're running Decentraland via a web browser, or if you're running a locally installed desktop client. The desktop client has considerably lower requirements, as it's not limited by the browser.  

> Note: Decentraland currently does not run on any mobile devices.
