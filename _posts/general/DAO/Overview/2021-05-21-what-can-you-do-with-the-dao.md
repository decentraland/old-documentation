The DAO allows for two general types of proposals: **proposals with binding actions**, and **information gathering polls**.

## Proposals with binding actions

The DAO allows the community to vote on **binding actions** that will result in changes made to Decentraland’s smart contracts on the Ethereum network. One of these binding actions is the transfer of the DAO’s MANA to fund community grants. Other binding actions that can be proposed to the DAO are:

* Adding a catalyst node to the network of servers that host and run Decentraland’s virtual world.
* Adding points of interest, or highlighted locations within the virtual world, to a list that is shown to users. This list helps users to find popular and interesting locations to explore.
* Banning a name from Decentraland. This proposal type allows users to ensure that avatars cannot be given offensive and harmful names.

## What about modifying the LAND or Estate smart contracts?

Right now, the DAO owns both the LAND and Estate smart contracts. Any modifications to either of these contracts must be carried out by the Security Advisory Board (SAB) and DAO Committee – groups of trusted and elected persons tasked with ensuring the continued security of these important pieces of Decentraland’s infrastructure.

The SAB must vote through a multi-sig wallet to approve any changes to the LAND or Estate contracts, preventing a rogue SAB member from introducing a vulnerability.

Currently, there are no predefined proposal categories for modifying the LAND or Estate smart contracts via the DAO’s UI. That doesn’t mean it is impossible for a non-SAB member to initiate changes, but it is a lengthier process that requires obtaining support from the broader community in addition to having the technical expertise needed to supply the code changes and a trusted third party to audit those changes.

The source code for the LAND and Estate contracts is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decentraland/land/tree/master/contracts).

Generally speaking, the process for modifying either contract would be:

* Polling the community via the DAO, and publicly discussing your proposed changes to gather support
* After gaining the community’s support, writing the updated code to be merged into the contract
* Obtaining a successful code review and audit from a reputable third-party
* Presenting the audited code to the community and obtaining their approval to have it merged with the contract
* Once approved by another community vote, the DAO Committee or SAB would perform the contract upgrade with the new code

## Non-binding polls

The Decentraland DAO also allows the community to create and vote in **non-binding multiple choice polls** that are intended to gather opinions and sentiments on topics related to the platform. When paired with discussion in the forum, this is a powerful tool for building consensus within the community, but it has no immediate binding actions.

**Always remember, the results of a poll do not necessitate any followup action.**
