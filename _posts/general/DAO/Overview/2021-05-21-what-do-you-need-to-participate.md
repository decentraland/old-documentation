Broadly speaking, DAOs are organizations comprising token holders. In Decentraland’s case, the tokens needed to be a member of the DAO are MANA and LAND. By holding either MANA or LAND, you may create and vote in proposals. Your vote on a proposal is weighted according to the balance of LAND and MANA you have at the time that proposal was created. For more information, see Voting power in the User Guide.

Anyone is allowed and welcome to participate in discussions related to the DAO in Discord, the Forum, or any of Decentraland’s other social channels, but only token holders can cast votes and create proposals.
