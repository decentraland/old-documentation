To [request a grant]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /general/DAO/Overview/2021-06-18-community-grants %}) from the Decentraland DAO, begin by navigating to **[governance.decentraland.org](https://governance.decentraland.org)** and signing in with your wallet.


Click **Submit a proposal** and choose **Grant request** from the list of proposal categories. You will be presented with a form that you must complete before submitting your request.

## Grant proposal forms

When you submit a grant request, you are expected to complete the proposal form to the best of your ability. Particular attention should be given to the abstract, description, specification, personnel, and roadmap sections. Failure to provide clear and relevant information may result in the rejection of your proposal by the community.

Following is an overview of the proposal form:

#### Category

Select the category that best describes your project. Currency, DAO grants will fund projects within four categories:

*   Community
*   Content Creator
*   Platform Contributor
*   Gaming

#### Tier

Select the most appropriate tier for your grant request. Tiers enable the Decentraland Community to limit the size and scope of the grants that are funded by the DAO. The initial possible tiers are:

*   **Tier 1:** $500 - $1500 USD in MANA
*   **Tier 2:** $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA
*   **Tier 3:** $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA

Tiers 1 and 2 are paid via a direct transfer to the beneficiary address provided within 7 days of a grant receiving approval from the DAO.

Tier 3 is paid via a vesting contract with a one month cliff.

#### Title

Provide a title that is concise and descriptive for your grant request. This title will appear as the header of your proposal’s detail page on [governance.decentraland.org](governance.decentraland.org), the proposal in Snapshot, and the Forum thread generated for your proposal.

#### Abstract

Use this space to provide a quick and easy to understand overview of your project. Your abstract should explain what problems your grant might solve, or what value it might provide to the greater community.

#### Grant size

Enter the exact amount of funding you are requesting for your grant in USD. This amount should be within range for the Tier you’ve selected. If your grant is approved, it will be paid in MANA according to the current exchange rate between USD and MANA.

#### Beneficiary address

Enter an Ethereum address that you can use to receive the funds if your grant is approved.

#### Description

This is where you can provide a longer and more detailed description of your project.

#### Specification

Here you can share a more detailed plan for what you would like to create or build. If there are any supporting assets or preliminary work, please share them here.

#### Personnel

If you are the only contributor to the project you would like to fund, enter some biographical information, making sure to include an overview of your skills and experience and why they are uniquely suited for your project. You are also strongly encouraged to provide links to a portfolio of previous work that is relevant to your proposed project.

If multiple people would contribute to your project, please share these details for each.

#### Roadmap and milestones

Please share a realistic and achievable timeline for your project with discrete milestones. It is important that you publicly share progress toward each milestone in the Forum thread generated for your grant. Milestones should include concrete deliverables and dates, to make it easy for the community to compare your actual progress with your initial proposal.

## Submitting your proposal

After filling out every field in the proposal form to the best of your abilities, click **Submit proposal**.

After submitting your proposal, a Forum thread will be generated automatically where the community can provide feedback on, or ask questions about, your project.

Grant requests remain open on the DAO for 7 days, during which the community can review and vote on your proposal.

## Minimum acceptance thresholds

As has been [voted in place by the DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=95141550-c3f4-11eb-b2bc-870b0f8c50b5), grant requests cannot be approved by the DAO unless 1 million VP or more votes in **For** the request and the **For** votes have the majority.

Failure to reach at least 1 million VP, even if the **For** votes are in the majority, results in the rejection of the proposal. Grant requests may be resubmitted, so if you fail to obtain approval, you may revise and resubmit your proposal at a later date.
