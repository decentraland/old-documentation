The Decentraland DAO has been granted with a **10-year vesting contract worth 222,000,000 MANA** started on Feb 19, 2020.
You can view the DAO’s vesting contract [here](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac). The MANA in this contract vests every second, thus gradually increasing the size of the DAO’s fund.

The current state of the DAO treasury can be viewed on the [Transparency page](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) of the [Governance dApp](https://governance.decentraland.org/).


The DAO also has other sources of income:

* A 2.5% transaction fee within the Decentraland Marketplacs on primary market commissions go to the DAO
* The OpenSea Marketplace also receives a 2.5% transaction fee for sales of LAND, Estates, Names, and wearables, [part of which is transferred to the DAO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942?a=0x9b814233894cd227f561b78cc65891aa55c62ad2).
