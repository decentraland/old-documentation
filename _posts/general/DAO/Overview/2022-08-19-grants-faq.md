## Where can I see my grant proposal? 

Go to https://governance.decentraland.org/ and make a search writing the proposal name on the search box. 

## Where can I find my vesting contract?

If your Grant TIER is 1 or 2, there will not be a vesting contract because the funds will be paid directly to the beneficiary address provided in the proposal form. These transfers are initiated by the DAO Committee within 7 days of the grant’s approval by the DAO.


If your Grant TIER is 3-4-5-6, the DAO Committee has to prepare the Vesting Contract, which will be available in a few days after the Grant was approved by the DAO and you will be able to see it in your Proposal Page when your Grant turns into ENACTED.
If  you don’t know the TIER of your grant, please check it out on [your grant proposal](#where-can-i-see-my-grant-proposal). 

## When can I start to release the funds of the grant I received?

Grant TIER 1 or 2: You can release your funds 7 days after the grant has been approved by the DAO, directly to the beneficiary address provided in [your grant proposal](#where-can-i-see-my-grant-proposal) form.


Grant TIER 3-4-5-6: 
You can start to release these funds one month after the grant has passed. 
These contracts vest every second, and have a one-month cliff.  This means you can start receiving your funds after the first month.  After that, you will be able to withdraw the funds whenever you find it convenient.
The beneficiaries are responsible for paying the gas fee required for each withdrawal.


## How can I release the Grants funds?
If your Grant TIER is 1 or 2, there will not be a vesting contract because the funds will be paid directly to the beneficiary address provided in the proposal form. These transfers are initiated by the DAO Committee within 7 days of the grant’s approval by the DAO.


If your Grant TIER is 3-4-5-6:

1. Go to [your grant proposal](#where-can-i-see-my-grant-proposal) page
2. Sign in with your wallet address
3. Click on the vesting contract, and you will see the release button.
4. Funds are withdrawn to your wallet



## Can I change the beneficiary address of my vesting contract?

Yes.  You will have to do a transaction on the blockchain, so it will have a gas fee cost.  
    
There are two differents ways to change the beneficiary address:

**1st: on the proposal page** 
1. Go to [your grant proposal](#where-can-i-see-my-grant-proposal) page
2. Sign in with your wallet address 
3. Click on the vesting contract, and you will see two buttons: release  and change beneficiary address. 
 
**2nd: using etherscan**
1. Go to etherscan.com
2. Sign in with the same wallet that you provided in your proposal
3. click on “WRITE CONTRACT”,
4. call the action “transfer ownership”
5. change it and sign the transaction.


## How to post updates on my proposal page? 

1. Go to [your grant proposal](#where-can-i-see-my-grant-proposal) page
2. Sign in with the wallet address of the grant owner (who submitted the proposal) 
3. This will display a menu that provides spaces to write about your project (“Introduction/highlights/blockers/next steps”) and to provide the project health (on track / at risk / off track) which you need to complete to submit your update.



## How frequently do I have to post updates? 

Grant owners must provide one [update](#how-to-post-updates-on-my-proposal-page) on their grant proposal page  every 30 days from the moment their Grant passed. This is the official way to report your progress.  Sharing screenshots or demos of your work goes a long way toward maintaining the trust of the community.

When your [vesting contract](#where-can-i-find-my-vesting-contract) period is finalized, you will receive an email from the Grant Support Squad asking you to submit a Final Report.

You can also share updates on your dedicated discord channel on the [DAO Decentraland server](https://discord.gg/hQ9vyuHsRg). These progress reports should be clear and concise, while still giving the community an accurate sense of how your project is progressing.

It is also expected that members of the Grant team attends to the [monthly TownHalls ](https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=cca6c7e2-8235-450c-b14e-e64691c136ba)to report progress.


## What happens if you miss an update?

The Grant Support Squad and the community will try to contact you to encourage you to do it or help you if you have any blocker.

Missing an update is an alarm for us and may trigger the  [Grant revocation process](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/receiving-grants/#revoked-grants).


## How can you request help?

Every Grant will be supported by the Grant Support Squad and by the rest of the community, so you can :

1.  Search for your dedicated discord channel on the [DAO Decentraland server](https://discord.gg/hQ9vyuHsRg) and ask the community for help.  
2. Send an email to Grant Support Squad ([Pablo](mailto:pablo.lewin@decentraland.org) / [Zino](mailto:juan.cassinelli@decentraland.org)


ALWAYS Check that the domain email address is from decentraland.org . We will never send you emails from outside this domain. Remember that the Decentraland DAO will NEVER ask you for your secret passphrase and we will never host a payment directly in Decentraland.
