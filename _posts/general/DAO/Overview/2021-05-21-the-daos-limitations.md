The most important thing to remember about the Decentraland DAO is that it is a specific governance tool with limited capabilities. Like a vending machine, the DAO is automated. However, this automation leads to limited options.

There is a finite number of functions within the DAOâ€™s smart contracts. These functions can easily be called by passing one of the binding proposals in the Governance UI, but the process for adding or modifying the functions within the DAO is much more complex.

The second most important thing to remember about the DAO is that it is an organization. Making changes to how this organization runs takes time and social momentum that can only be built up through fostering productive relationships and dialogue with the broader Decentraland community.
