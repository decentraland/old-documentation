The original Decentraland white paper written by Esteban Ordano, Ariel Meilich, Yemel Jardi, and Manuel Araoz can be found using the link below.

This white paper presents a detailed explanation of the original philosophical motivations behind the Decentraland project, along with a rigorous discussion of the proposed technical and economic approaches to building Decentraland. Please keep in mind that the Decentraland project is continually evolving, and some of the approaches outlined in the white paper have been modified.
