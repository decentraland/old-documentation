## Decentraland's Estate Marketplace Integration

The Decentraland's Estate is an ERC721 compliant NFT and runs in Ethereum Mainnet. Therefore a lot of third party marketplaces can trade them. In order to do so, this marketplace must follow
certain rules in order to make keep trades secure for the users.

Each [Estate](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/faq/#what-is-an-estate) is a group of [LANDs](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/faq/#what-is-land). That group of LANDs creates a _`fingerprint`_ for the Estate. The _`fingerprint`_ is a _bytes_ hash. Everytime the Estate changes by adding or removing a LAND, its _`fingerprint`_ changes too.

For marketplaces, especially the ones without an escrow system, it is 100% recommended to have a record of the Estate's _`fingerprint`_ when someone list it for sale or makes an offer. That way, when the order/offer is successfully executed, the current owner can't change the estate by trying to front-run the order execution.

### Example

#### Not use the Estate fingerprint

- Bob has the Estate1 with LAND (1,1) and (1,2). Estate1 fingerprint: hash1
- Bob add the LAND (1,3) to Estate1. The Estate1 has the LANDs: (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). Estate1 fingerprint: hash2 (Fingerprint changed)
- Bob remove the LAND (1,1) from Estate1. The Estate1 has the LANDs: (1,2) and (1,3). Estate1 fingerprint: hash3 (Fingerprint changed)
- Bob put on sale the Estate1. The list is created onchain in the Ethereum mainnet with the Estate smart contract address, the Estate id, the price and the expiration date.
- Alice send a transaction to buy the Estate specifiyng the estate id and the price expected to pay.
- Bob detects that someone is trying to buy his Estate1 and send a transaction with higher gas fees than Alice to remove the LANDs (1,2) and (1,3) from Estate1.
- Bob's transactions is mined first. Estate1 has 0 LANDs. Estate1 fingerprint: hash4 (Fingerprint changed)
- Alice's transaction is mined later. Alice bought the Estate1 with 0 LANDs on it. It means that Alice got front-runned (and steal/scammed) by Bob.

#### Use the Estate fingerprint

- Bob has the Estate1 with LAND (1,1) and (1,2). Estate1 fingerprint: hash1
- Bob add the LAND (1,3) to Estate1. The Estate1 has the LANDs: (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). Estate1 fingerprint: hash2 (Fingerprint changed)
- Bob remove the LAND (1,1) from Estate1. The Estate1 has the LANDs: (1,2) and (1,3). Estate1 fingerprint: hash3 (Fingerprint changed)
- Bob put on sale the Estate1. The list is created onchain in the Ethereum mainnet with the Estate smart contract address, the Estate id, the price, the expiration date.
- Alice send a transaction to buy the Estate specifiyng the estate id, the price expected to pay, and **the fingerprint she saw (hash3)**.
- Bob detects that someone is trying to buy his Estate1 and send a transaction with higher gas fees than Alice to remove the LANDs (1,2) and (1,3) from Estate1.
- Bob's transactions is mined first. Estate1 has 0 LANDs. Estate1 fingerprint: hash4 (Fingerprint changed)
- Alice's transaction is reverted because the smart contract checked that the fingerprint in the param that Alice sent didn't match with the current Estate1 fingerprint (hash3 != hash4). This check prevented Alice to buy a non desired Estate.

### Estate Smart Contract Interface

The Estate's smart contract is compliant with a [fingerprint interface](https://github.com/decentraland/land/blob/master/contracts/estate/EstateStorage.sol#L19). In order to check if an order/offer for an estate is still valid or not you can call the _`verifyFingerprint(uint256 estateId, bytes fingerprint)`_ function implemented in the Estate smart contract. You can check a working production example [here](https://github.com/decentraland/marketplace-contracts/blob/master/contracts/marketplace/MarketplaceV2.sol#L382)
