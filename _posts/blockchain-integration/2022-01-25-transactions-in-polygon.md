## What is Polygon?

As stated in the the official Polygon website, [“Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Aggregating scalable solutions on Ethereum supporting a multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem.”

## What is Matic?

MATIC is Polygon’s native token. It is a cryptocurrency used to cover gas fees in the Polygon network, among other use cases. MATIC is to Polygon as Eth is to Ethereum.
You can buy MATIC in most cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Polygon in Decentraland’s Marketplace

By using the Polygon network, and thanks to Decentraland’s DAO, users can list, sell and buy wearables for free. But **transactions in Polygon are not free**. The Decentraland Foundation covers the cost of the transactions in Polygon, but there is a “free transaction limit”.

## What is the free transaction limit?

Transactions on the Polygon network cost gas. The Decentraland DAO covers the cost up to a certain limit, so that users can enjoy many costless transactions in the Marketplace.

## Transactions on the Polygon network cost gas.

The Decentraland DAO covers the cost up to a certain limit, so that users can enjoy many costless transactions in the Marketplace.

## What happens if the free transaction limit is reached?

The free transaction limit renews every day, so you can try again tomorrow. Alternatively, you can cover the cost of your transaction with MATIC while being connected to the Polygon network.

The MATIC fee will be deducted automatically as part of the transaction. You only need to be connected to the Polygon network and have MATIC in your wallet.

Gas fees are variable.
