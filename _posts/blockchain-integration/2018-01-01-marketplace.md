The Marketplace is the go-to place to trade and manage all your Decentraland on-chain assets.

Access the Marketplace at [market.decentraland.org](https://market.decentraland.org/)

The Marketplace allows you to:

- **Sell** parcels and Estates of LAND. Set your own price in MANA and an expiration date for the offer.
- **Buy** parcels and Estates that are for sale.
- **Name** your parcels and Estates and give them a public description.
- **Transfer** your parcels and Estates to another user.
- **Grant permissions** to other users to edit the parcels you own.
- **Explore** the world through a map to see who owns what.

> The Marketplace is in a beta release. We kindly ask that you protect your personal information, property, and content. If you run into any issues or would like to provide feedback, click on the Intercom Widget right in the Marketplace.

## Your Wallet

Before using [market.decentraland.org](https://market.decentraland.org), connect and log into an Ethereum client account that can interact with the web browser. We recommend using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist). We also support the use of a [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) hardware wallet.

> Note: If you would like to use your Ledger hardware wallet in the Marketplace, first enable browser support on your device. Next, plug your device into your computer, and select the address you used during the auction. Finally, unlock your wallet and load up the Marketplace.

When navigating the Marketplace, your wallet address is treated as your account, you don't need any additional log in.

Since all transactions in the Ethereum network have a gas fee that needs to be paid in Ether, your account needs to have at least some Ether in it to perform any actions in the Marketplace.

## The Atlas View

The Atlas view gives you a bird’s-eye perspective of every color coded parcel, Estate, road, district, and plaza in Decentraland.

You can click and drag the map to move around, zoom in and out, or hover your cursor over a parcel to see its x,y location and owner.

Any parcel that is currently for sale in the Marketplace will be highlighted.

Hover your cursor over a parcel to view it’s status, its coordinates, and its owner’s public address (if it has an owner). Click on a parcel to view more details.

## The Marketplace View

If you’d rather see a list of all the LAND currently offered on the market, you can use the Marketplace View. Select the tabs at the top to switch between individual parcels and multi-parcel Estates. You can sort offers by “Newest”, “Cheapest”, “Most expensive”, and “Closest to expire”. Click a tile to learn more about it.

5. Confirm this transaction on your Ethereum client and wait for the network to verify it.

> Note: Aside from the gas fee that the Ethereum network pays to the miners of the transaction, Decentraland does not collect any surplus trading fees.

## Make a bid on a parcel or Estate

If a parcel or estate isn't listed on sale, you can still place a bid on it and offer to buy it at a specific price.

1. To enable the _bid_ feature on the Marketplace, navigate to your Settings, and check the box next to _Assets using MANA (bid)_. You’ll have to pay a small gas fee, just like any other Ethereum transaction.

2. Navigate back to the LAND you want to bid on, then click _Bid_ to make an offer!

3. Enter the amount of MANA you want to offer the seller.

4. Set the date for when you want your offer to expire. Bids can be open for no more than six months. After six months, you’ll have to place another bid.

5. Click Submit.

6. Re-enter your offer amount one more time to confirm the bid.

To view a list of your open and pending bids, click _MY LAND_ on the top navbar and select _Bids_.

From this screen you can also change the price of your bid by clicking _Update_.

## Sell a parcel or Estate

To sell one of your plots of LAND for MANA:

1. Open **My LAND** and select the parcel or Estate you'd like to sell.
2. In the details page, click **Sell**.
3. Set a price and expiration date and click **Confirm**.
4. Confirm this transaction on your Ethereum client and wait for the network to verify it.

You can change the price of a sale that you already put on offer without having to cancel and re-create the sale. Just click **Update price** in the parcel or estate's details page.

## Create an Estate

LAND Estates make it possible to associate two or more directly adjacent parcels of LAND to make it easier to manage your larger LAND holdings. Estates are especially useful when building larger scenes that span more than one parcel.

Parcels in an Estate must be directly adjacent, and cannot be separated by a road, plaza, or any other parcel.

To create your first Estate, you need to own two or more adjacent LAND parcels.

1. Open **My LAND** and select one of the parcels you'd like to add to the Estate.
2. In the parcel's details page, click **Create Estate**.
3. You will be shown a view of the Atlas centered on the parcel you selected, with the remaining adjacent parcels you own highlighted. Select the different parcels you want to include in your Estate.
   ![](/images/media/market_estates1.png)

4. Click **Continue**.
5. Enter a name and description for your Estate. These details will be publicly displayed in the Atlas, just like the name and description for any individual parcel.

   ![](/images/media/market_estates2.png)

6. Confirm this transaction on your Ethereum client and wait for the network to verify it.

Once you’ve created your first Estate, you will see a new tab titled Estates. From this page you can view and manage all of your Estates.

When you create a new Estate, you are effectively transferring your parcels to a new token. These Estates are represented by ERC721 tokens (like any other NFT). You will no longer see the individual parcels under _My Land_, and they will not appear in MetaMask, Mist, Trezor, or Ledger wallets, nor on Etherscan under your address.

## Edit parcels or Estates

You can edit the name and description of any parcel or Estate that you own. These details will be publicly displayed in the Atlas.

To edit a parcel or Estate:

1. Navigate to the details page of the parcel or the Estate you'd like to edit and click **Edit**.

   ![](/images/media/marketplace_edit_parcel.png)

2. Click **Submit**
3. Confirm this transaction on your Ethereum client and wait for the network to verify it.

## Give permissions

You can give another user permissions to edit the content in a parcel or estate. This enables that user to deploy code to the scene, whilst not having the ability to sell the token.

The user given permission can also change the name or description in the Marketplace.

To grant permissions over your LAND:

1. Navigate to the details page of the parcel or estate and click **Permissions**.

   ![](/images/media/marketplace_give_permissions.png)

2. Click **Submit**
3. Confirm this transaction on your Ethereum client and wait for the network to verify it.

## See your activity history

Open the notifications page by clicking the bell icon at the top of the screen.

![](/images/media/marketplace_notifications.png)

The notifications page displays a list of all the recent transactions that you have carried out, together with their status.

Click a transaction to see more details about it on Etherscan.

## Transfer MANA

To transfer MANA to another account:

1. Open your user _Settings page_
2. Click **Transfer**
3. Enter the public address of the Ethereum wallet of the recipient.

   ![](/images/media/9ff24a6-transfer_LAND_screenshot.png)

> Note: Please double check this address, since you cannot cancel the operation.

4. Click **Submit**.
5. Confirm this transaction on your Ethereum client and wait for the network to verify it.

## Transfer LAND

To transfer a LAND parcel or Estate to another user:

1. Navigate to the details page of the parcel or the Estate you'd like to transfer and click **Transfer**

   ![](/images/media/marketplace_transfer_land.png)

2. Enter the public address of the Ethereum wallet of the recipient.

> Note: Please double check this address, since you cannot cancel the operation. While the recipient could always transfer the LAND back to you, the original owner cannot reverse the action.

3. Click **Submit**.
4. Confirm this transaction on your Ethereum client and wait for the network to verify it.

## Apply for a mortgage to buy a parcel or estate

Before you can request a LAND mortgage, you will have to approve the Ripio Credit Network’s smart contracts to conduct transactions on your behalf using your MANA and RCN tokens. Open your **Account Settings** in the upper right corner, and check the two **LAND by Mortgage** boxes. (You only need MANA to request a mortgage, RCN will convert the MANA you use to the RCN token for you.)

Next, navigate to the parcel that you wish to request a mortgage for. Click **Request Mortgage**, directly next to the Buy button.

Next, you will have to submit a brief application form including the following details and a deposit of at least 10% of the price of the parcel you wish to buy.

- **Amount requested**: the amount of MANA that you need for your mortgage.
- **Duration**: how long (in days) you have to pay off your mortgage at the standard interest rate. Once the duration is reached, you will have to pay the punitory interest rate until the mortgage is paid off or defaulted.
- **Payable at**: this represents the minimum amount of interest you will pay, regardless of when you pay off your mortgage. For example, if you take out a mortgage lasting 30 days, with a Payable at of 10 days, then you will be charged for at least 10 days of interest (even if you pay off your mortgage within one day of your request).
- **Interest rate**: the annual interest rate for your mortgage.
- **Punitory interest rate**: the amount of additional interest you must pay if you do not pay off your mortgage before the duration of your mortgage.
- **Request expiration**: how long the mortgage will be listed on RCN. If this date is reached and no one fulfills your mortgage request, you will have to request another mortgage.

Once you request your mortgage, it will be published to the RCN network. Remember, so long as your mortgage request is still open on RCN, anyone else may purchase the parcel. A mortgage request does not take a parcel off of the Marketplace until a _lender_ fulfills the mortgage.

Any lender on RCN can supply the funds and fulfill the loan (as long as the parcel in question is still for sale). Once a lender fulfils the loan, the parcel will be transferred to a separate smart contract for the mortgage and will no longer be available on the market for other buyers.

As a borrower, you can then repay the loan by making periodic payments through the Decentraland Marketplace.

If you fail to fully repay the loan, you have up to 7 days after the expiration date to repay your loan. After this period, then your lender may request the mortgage back through the RCN dApp. If your lender requests the mortgage back, you will see a “Defaulted” notice on the parcel page. You will lose the MANA you’ve paid, along with your ability to claim that parcel.

You can see a list of your open mortgages by clicking **My Land** in the Decentraland Marketplace, and selecting the **Mortgages** tab.

To make a payment, click **Pay** in the mortgage's details page, enter the amount of MANA you want to include in your payment, and click **Submit**.

Once you have completely paid off your mortgage, you can claim your parcel. Simply navigate to the parcel’s page in the Marketplace, and click **Claim Parcel**. Now, the parcel is freed from the mortgage smart contract is transferred to your account.
