To get you up and running, and to illustrate what kind of experiences you can build using the SDK, we’ve put together some code and scene examples.

Some of these scenes feature a link to a version of the scene that's deployed on a remote server. There you can interact with it just as if you were running `dcl start` locally.

## Static XML Scenes

#### Static XML Scene

A completely static scene. It's built entirely using XML, which makes it easier to write and edit, but doesn't support any changes over time or interactions with the user.

## Network connections

#### Weather simulation

A scene that checks a weather API for the weather in a location and displays that weather condition, showing rain, thunder or snowflakes
Use real weather data from different locations by changing the coordinates, or change the value of the “fakeWeather” variable to see different weather conditions manifest.

- Call external REST API

#### Remote door

A scene that uses a server and a REST API to sync a scene state amongst multiple users. It’s built around the basic “open the door” example.

- Create a REST server
- Call REST API

#### Remote mural

A scene that uses a server and a REST API to sync a scene state amongst multiple users. You can paint pixels in a mural that other users can see. The colors of each pixel are stored in a remote server.

- Create a REST server
- Call REST API

#### Tower defense game (WIP)

A fully-fledged game where a random 2d path is generated along which enemies walk, and where traps are randomly placed. You need to activate the traps as the enemies advance along the path to kill them. It’s all about timing.
