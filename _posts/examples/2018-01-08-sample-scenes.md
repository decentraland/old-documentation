To get you up and running, and to illustrate what kind of experiences you can build using the SDK, weâ€™ve put together some code and scene examples.

Some of these scenes feature a link to a version of the scene that's deployed on a remote server. There you can interact with it just as if you were running `dcl start` locally.

# Clone an example scene

Instead of creating a new scene from scratch, you can clone one of the existing example scenes and use that as a starting point.

To do so:

1. Find an example you like from the ones listed below.
2. Open the **Code** link to visit its GitHub repo.
3. From there you can either:
   1. _Fork the repo_ to work on your own version of it, that will exist in a cloned GitHub repo that belongs to you.
   2. Click **Clone or Download** and select to download it as a _.zip_ file, to work on the files locally, without GitHub being involved.

# Examples

Visit the [Decentraland awesome repository](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/Awesome-Repository) for a large catalogue of example scenes, each tackling one particular challenge.
