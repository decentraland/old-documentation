## A simple interactive scene

This simple tutorial walks you through creating a simple scene where user clicks can cause an entity to rotate.

## Using 3D models in Decentraland

#### Add predefined animations to a 3D model

This tutorial shows you how you can download a freely licenced 3D model from Google Poly, and apply free animations that you can download from Mixamo to it.

It then also goes over how you can activate these animations in a Decentraland scene.

#### Add animations to a 3D model in Blender

This tutorial shows how you can download a freely licenced 3D model from Google Poly, import it into Blender and then create an _armature_ to manually create your own _animations_ for it.

It then also goes over how you can activate these animations in a Decentraland scene.

#### Add a collider to a 3D model

This tutorial shows how you can add a collider to a 3D model. Colliders prevent users of your scene from walking through things. They are separate objects that are invisible but occupy space and stand in for what are often more geometrically complex objects.

## Advanced coding in Decentraland scenes

#### Jukebox

**Buttons, sound, and rendering from arrays**

This tutorial shows how you can build a jukebox. It includes an array of animated buttons that can be interacted with, each button triggers the playing of a different song.

This tutorial includes a [written guide](https://steemit.com/tutorial/@hardlydifficult/decentraland-tutorial-creating-a-music-jukebox) to accompany the video.

#### Block Dog

**Simple AI for character, event handling and using a state machine**

This tutorial shows how you can handle some basic behaviors of character in a Decentraland scene. The dog in this scene does the following:

- It randomly sits and stands up on its own.
- If you click the dog, it switches from standing up to sitting down.
- If you click the water bowl, it walks towards it and drinks.
- If you step inside the bounds of the scene, the dog follows you and sits in front of you.

This tutorial includes a [written guide](https://steemit.com/tutorial/@hardlydifficult/decentraland-tutorial-basic-ai-with-block-dog) to accompany the video.

#### Tower defense game

**Random content generation, path following, event handling, rendering from arrays and keeping score**

This tutorial shows how you can build a simple yet fully functional game in Decentraland. It walks you through how to create a tower defense game that includes:

- A randomly generated path
- Traps that appear in random positions
- A series of enemy entities that move down the generated path
- A way to kill these enemies via traps
- A score board
- A reset button
- Support for multiple players

This tutorial includes a [written guide](https://steemit.com/tutorial/@hardlydifficult/decentraland-tutorial-a-simple-tower-defense-game) to accompany the video.

#### Dog, cat, mouse, and cheese game

**Stack-based finit state machine, path finding with a\*, random content generation, custom event handling**

This tutorial shows how to build a more complex scene that involves predators and prays, which can interchangeably be mice, cats or dogs. Each animal has a stack-based finite state machine (FSM) to manage its AI. Each animal uses the a\* path finding algorithm to find its way around obstacles and other animals.

This tutorial includes a [written guide](https://steemit.com/tutorial/@hardlydifficult/decentraland-tutorial-dog-cat-mouse-cheese-using-a-fsm) to accompany the video.
