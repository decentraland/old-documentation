Once you have [built a new scene]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /documentation/building-scenes/2018-01-03-create-scene %}) ) or downloaded a [sample scene]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /documentation/building-scenes/2018-01-08-sample-scenes %}) ) you can preview it locally.

## Before you begin

Please make sure you first install the CLI tools. In Mac OS, you do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g decentraland
```

See the [Installation Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /documentation/building-scenes/2018-01-01-installation-guide %}) for more details and specific instructions for Windows and Linux systems.

## Preview a local scene

To preview a local scene run the following command on the scene's main folder:

```bash
dcl preview
```

Any dependencies that are missing are installed and then the CLI opens the scene in a new browser tab automatically. It creates a local web server in your system and opens a new web browser tab pointing at its local address.

Every time you make changes to the scene, the preview reloads and updates automatically, so there's no need to run the command again.


## Preview a remote scene

To preview a remote scene you must first start a WebSockets server in your local machine. To do this:

From the scene directory run the following bash commands:

```bash
$:  cd server

$:  npm install
# npm will find your dependencies

$:  npm run build
# npm will build the socket server

$:  npm start
# now the port is running
```

Note that when the server is running, the command informs you what port that the server is running on, take note of this. It will probably be 8087. 

Check that the `scene.json` file in your scene has the same websocket port set up, otherwise change the file so that it matches the local server you're running. 

Once the websocket server is up and the scene is properly pointing at it, fire up the preview as you would with a local scene.

From the scene directory run the following bash command:

``` bash
$:  dcl preview
```
Any missing dependencies are installed and then the CLI opens the scene in a new browser tab automatically.



## Upload a scene to decentraland

Once you're happy with your scene, you can upload it and publish it to Decentraland, see [publishing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /documentation/building-scenes/2018-01-07-publishing %}) ) for instructions on how to do that.

## Parameters of the preview command


You can add the following flags to the command to change its behavior:

* `--no-browser` to prevent the preview from opening a new browser tab.
* `--port` to assign a specific port to run the scene. Otherwise it will use whatever port is available.
* `--skip` to skip the confirmation prompt.

> To preview old scenes that were built for older versions of the SDK, you must install the latest versions of the `metaverse-api` and `metaverse-rpc` packages in your project. Check the CLI version via the command `dcl -v`


## Basic usage of the scene preview

Running a preview provides some useful debugging information and tools to help you understand how the scene is rendered. The preview mode provides information that describes parcel boundaries and the orientation of the scene.

If an entity is located or extends beyond the limits of the scene, it will flash with red color to indicate this. Nothing in your scene can extend beyond the scene limits. If you're building a scene to be uploaded to an estate that occupies more parcels than the preview shows, you can edit the `scene.json` file to reflect this, listing multiple parcels in the "parcels" field.

When viewing a preview, you can press the Esc key to disengage the mouse and use it normally.

If your scene outputs messages to console (using `console.log()`) you can view these messages as they are generated by opening the JavaScript console of your browser. For example, when using Chrome you access this through `View > Developer > JavaScript console`.

The scene informs you of the frames per second (FPS) of your scene. The performance depends in part on your local machine, but a bad amount of FPS may be an indication that the scene is too complicated to render smoothly.


## View collision meshes

While viewing the preview, you can press `c` to view any collision meshes loaded in the glTF models of the scene. These are usually invisible, but determine where an avatar can move through, and where it can't.

Collision meshes can be added to any model in an external 3D modeling tool like Blender. Large models like houses often include these, they are usually a lot simpler geometrically than the original shape, as this implies a lot less computational requirements. Stairs typically use a simplified collision mesh like a ramp to make it easier to climb, otherwise a character would have to jump up every step.
