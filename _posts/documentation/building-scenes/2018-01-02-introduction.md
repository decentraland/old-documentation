Welcome to our introduction on how to build on Decentraland. Allow us to start by introducing the concepts behind how the decentralized metaverse works.

The content you deploy to your LAND is called **scene**, it is usually an interactive program that renders content. It
could be a game, an elevator, a video screen, an art gallery, whatever you want.

If you come from the game development area, you may expect to have some kind of render loop and render elements in the
screen inside that loop. Decentraland doesn't work that way, we run your scene in a different context from the engine,
for safety and performance reasons, also we don't want users to touch the internals of the engine or even know what is
inside the engine because we need to ensure a consistent experience for every user and mistakes are more like to happen
at that "low" level.

Also other main difference with the event-loop based games is we built the API based on events, so we expect the scenes
to be reacting to events instead of being querying the world repeatedly.

## How does the scenes work?

Decoupling, it is all about decoupling. As we said before, your scenes doesn't run inside the same context of the engine
(a.k.a. main thread), or sometimes in the same computer the engine is running. We created the SDK in a way that is
entirely decoupled from the rendering engine. It works using a RPC protocol that controls a little part of the client
only to render the scene and control the events.

## Decoupling the scene from the engine

Let's do it with an example, imagine you want to render a scene with the following shape

```xml
<scene>
  <obj-model src="a.obj" />
  <sphere position="10 10 10" />
</scene>
```

In your scene code, you have no need to actually load the `a.obj` model, you don't need to know the geometry indexes of
the sphere either. So, you describe the scene in a higher level, like it is an XML.

Then we need to send the scene to the engine and it will take care of the positions, assets and geometries.

To optimize things a little bit, we only send the differences in the to the actual client, so if you have a shoal of
fishes and you move only one, the SDK will send only that delta, the moved fish. This makes things faster for the client
and it is completely transparent to the programmer of the scene.

## Removing code friction

One of the design goals of our SDK was to reduce the learning curve as much as possible, as well incentive good
practices and maintainable code, respecting the remote async-rpc constraints in any case. Roughly, we had two ways
to achieve this:

- **the jQuery way**: tell the computer how to handle entities, create, mutate and try to reach a desired state
- **the React way**: tell the computer the desired state

---

If we choose the jQuery way, our code to create the previous scene would look like this:

```ts
// IMPORTANT: This code is only an example, it does not exist nor work

let scene = metaverse.createScene()
let objModel = metaverse.createObjModel()
let sphere = metaverse.createSphere()

objModel.setAttribute('src', 'a.obj')
objModel.appendTo(scene)

sphere.setAttribute('position', {x: 10, y: 10, z: 10})
sphere.appendTo(scene)

EntityController.render(scene)
```

In the previous example, we are telling the computer how to reach a desired state, the example (ab)uses mutations and
side effects in code to reach that state.

---

If we choose the React way, our code to create the previous scene would look like this:

```tsx
// IMPORTANT: This code is only an example, it does not exist nor work

const scene =
  <scene>
    <obj-model src="a.obj" />
    <sphere position={ {x: 10, y: 10, z: 10} } />
  </scene>

EntityController.render(scene)
```

In the previous example, we are telling the computer the desired state, instead of all the logic to get that state.

We took advantage of the evolution of web technologies during the last 10 years and went for the React way, for several
reasons:

- It is simpler to understand, it removes tons of boilerplate code non related to the business logic of the scene
- It is descriptive, you describe **what** do you want, not **how**
- It will help onboard React developers
- The pattern is well known and well documented, getting help should be easy
- Low memory footprint and easy to do garbage collection

> **Note:** Even though it looks like React, **our SDK DOES NOT USE REACT**
