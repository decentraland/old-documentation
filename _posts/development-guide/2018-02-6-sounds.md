Supported sound formats vary depending on the browser, but it's safe to use _.mp3_, _.accc_ and _.ogg_.

_.wav_ files are also supported but not generally recommended as they are significantly larger.

## Import the sound controller

```ts
import { playSound } from "@decentraland/SoundController"
```

## Play a sound

```ts
executeTask(async () => {
  try {
    await playSound("sneaky_menu.mp3", {
      loop: true,
      volume: 100
    })
  } catch {
    log("failed to play sound")
  }
})
```

The `src` property points to the location of the sound file.

In the example above, the audio file is located in a `sounds` folder, which is located at root level of the scene project folder.

> Tip: We recommend keeping your sound files separate in a `/sounds` folder inside your scene.

## Loop a sound

<!---

Setting loop to false stops the audio, it doesn't pause it. So when setting loop to true the audio will start from the beginning.

Setting playing to false pauses??????

same for video??

## Make an entity play a sound

You can add sound to your scene by including a sound component in any entity.

Each entity can only play a single sound file. This limitation can easily be overcome by including multiple invisible entities, each with their own sound file.

The `distanceModel` property of the sound component conditions how the user's distance to the sound's source affects its volume. The model can be _linear_, _exponential_ or _inverse_. When using the linear or exponential model, you can also set the `rolloffFactor` property to set the steepness of the curve.

```ts
```

## Pool sound objects
