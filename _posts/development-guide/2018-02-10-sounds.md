Sound is a great way to provide feedback to user actions and events, background sounds can also give your scene more context and improve the user's immersion into it.

You can either trigger sounds from a specific entity, or from the scene itself.

> Note: Keep in mind that sounds from your scene will be also heard by users that are outside your scene but in hearing range, so be considerate with neighboring scenes when setting volumes and volume curves.

Supported sound formats vary depending on the browser, but it's safe to use _.mp3_, _.accc_ and _.ogg_.

_.wav_ files are also supported but not generally recommended as they are significantly larger.

## Import the sound controller

To use sounds, you must first import the `SoundController` into your scene:

```ts
import { playSound } from "@decentraland/SoundController"
```

## Play a sound

You can play a sound directly from your scene. Sounds played in this way are heard as sounding from the center of your scene. This is a good way to handle ambience and general notification sounds that don't need to have a specific source.

```ts
executeTask(async () => {
  try {
    await playSound("sounds/wind_blowing.mp3", {
      volume: 100
    })
  } catch {
    log("failed to play sound")
  }
})
```

The `src` property points to the location of the sound file.

In the example above, the audio file is located in a `sounds` folder, which is located at root level of the scene project folder.

> Tip: We recommend keeping your sound files separate in a `/sounds` folder inside your scene.

## Loop a sound

To keep a sound playing in a continuous loop, set the `loop` field to _true_. This is useful for adding background music or other background sounds.

Setting loop to _false_ stops the audio, it doesn't pause it. So when setting loop to _true_ again, the audio sample will start from the beginning.

```ts
executeTask(async () => {
  try {
    await playSound("sounds/sneaky_menu.mp3", {
      loop: true,
      volume: 100
    })
  } catch {
    log("failed to play sound")
  }
})
```

## Make an entity play a sound

You can add sound to your scene by including a sound component in any entity.

Each entity can only play a single sound file. This limitation can easily be overcome by including multiple invisible entities, each with their own sound file.

The `distanceModel` property of the sound component conditions how the user's distance to the sound's source affects its volume. The model can be _linear_, _exponential_ or _inverse_. When using the linear or exponential model, you can also set the `rolloffFactor` property to set the steepness of the curve.

```ts
```

## Volume curves

You can also change how volume levels relate to distance from the sound source to put more or less emphasis on a sound's location.

```ts
```

## Pool sound objects

A great way to save processing power is to have a series of pooled sound objects and only assign them to entities when needed.

Suppose you have a large amount of balls bouncing around in your scene, and you want to hear a _thump_ sound every time two of them collide. Instead of adding a `sound` component to each ball, each containing a reference to the same audio sample, you can have a couple of instanced sound components ready to be temporarily assigned to any ball that needs them. After the sound is played, the sound components can be unassigned from the entity and wait for the next ball that needs them.

```ts
```
