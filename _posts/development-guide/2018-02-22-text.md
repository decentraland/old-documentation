Add text to a scene using the `TextShape` component. This text sits in a position

Text in Decentraland supports all _utf8_ characters, this includes oriental and special characters.

> Note: This component is useful for in-world labels and UIs that exist in the 3D space of the scene, not for the user's 2D HUD UI.

The `TextShape` component is mutually exclusive with other shape components like primitive shapes and glTF 3D models, see [Shape components]() for more details.
