## Track user position and rotation

The `Camera` object exposes information about the user's point of view in your scene.

- `camera.position` returns a 3D vector with the user's coordinates relative to the scene.
- `camera.rotation` returns a quaternion with the user's rotation.

> Tip: You can also obtain the user's rotation expressed in [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles) angles (as an _x_, _y_ and _z_ vector) by writing `camera.rotation.eulerAngles`.

```ts
const camera = Camera.instance

class CameraTrackSystem {
  update() {
    log(camera.position)
    log(camera.rotation.eulerAngles)
  }
}
```

The example above logs the user's position and rotation on each frame.

```ts
const camera = Camera.instance

class SomeSystem  {
  entity : Entity;
  constructor(entity : Entity) {
    this.entity = entity
  }

  update() {
      const transform = this.entity.getComponent(Transform)
      transform.rotation = camera.rotation
  }
}

const cube = new Entity()
const shape = new BoxShape()
const transform = new Transform()
transform.position.set(5, 1, 5)
cube.addComponent(shape)
cube.addComponent(transform)

engine.addEntity(cube)
engine.addSystem(new SomeSystem(cube))
```

The example above uses the user's rotation to set that of a cube in the scene.

## Get player's public Ethereum key

To get a user's Ethereum public key, use the `EthereumController` library. See [scene blockchain operations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /blockchain-interactions/2018-01-07-scene-blockchain-operations %}) for details.


<!--
You can obtain a user's public Ethereum key by using `getUserPublicKey()`. You can then use this information to send payments to the user, or as a way to recognize users.

The example below imports the `Identity` library and runs `getUserPublicKey()` to get the public key of the user's Ethereum account and log it to console. The user must be logged into their Metamask account on their browser for this to work.

```ts
import { getUserPublicKey } from "@decentraland/Identity"

const publicKeyRequest = executeTask(async () => {
  const publicKey = await getUserPublicKey()
  log(publicKey)
  return publicKey
})

class IDSystem implements ISystem {
  update() {
    if (publicKeyRequest.didFail) {
      log("error fetching id" + publicKeyRequest.error)
    } else {
      log("id:" + publicKeyRequest.result)
    }
  }
}
```

Note that we're using an async function to run the `getUserPublicKey()` function, as it might take some time to retrieve this data. We're then handling the data in a system, to be able to use it whenever it's ready.


## Get all user data

You can obtain a user's display name and public Ethereum key by using `getUserData()`.

The example below imports the `Identity` library and runs `getUserData()`.

```ts
import { getUserData } from "@decentraland/Identity"

const userData = executeTask(async () => {
  const data = await getUserData()
  log(data.displayName)
  return data.displayName
})
```

Note that we're using an async function to run the `getUserData()` function, as it might take some time to retrieve this data. We're then handling the data in a system, to be able to use it whenever it's ready.
